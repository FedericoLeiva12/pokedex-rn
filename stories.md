- Create a "favorites" system where you can store one or several pokemon as favorites.
- Create a "*" button to the right of each pokemon.
- Pressing this button should add the pokemon to favorites.
- If you decided that only one favorite could be added, the old pokemon should be removed and replaced with the new one.
